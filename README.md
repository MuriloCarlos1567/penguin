Welcome to the wonderful frozen world of Penguin, a Python framework as secure as an ice rink in a figure skating competition! 🐧 Developed with the philosophy of "fun above all," Penguin is a deep dive into the realm of asynchronicity and multithreading, where security is a strange word that only appears in more serious tutorials.

Picture a world where threads dance on the ice, async is the soundtrack, and the only commitment is to ensure that the fun never stops. Penguin is your VIP pass to this spectacle, where bugs are just unexpected dance steps, and the only rule is not to take yourself too seriously.

This framework was created for competitions, but don't expect to find firewalls or encryption here - after all, the focus is on unleashing your imagination, not protecting confidential data. So, if you're ready for a frosty adventure and code filled with humor, welcome Penguin to your project and let the fun begin! 🎉❄️

_Note: Penguin is still under construction, so get ready for even more icy excitement in the updates to come!_ ❄️🔨
